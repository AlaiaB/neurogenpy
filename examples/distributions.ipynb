    "The joint distribution is stored in a `ModifiableJointDistribution` object. This object uses `GaussianJointDistribution` objects (`DiscreteJointDistribution` is not yet available) to represent two different distributions: the initial joint distribution (with no evidence set) and the current joint distribution (taking into account the evidence set by the user). The initial joint distribution is stored in a temporary file in order to recover it if needed and the current joint distribution is kept in memory or also saved in a temporary file depending on the value of the attribute `save_dist`. Saving the distribution is thought for networks with a lot of nodes, where an $N \\times N$ matrix is used. The network is considered big if $N>300$.\n",

    "If you stick to using the `BayesianNetwork` class, the only time you could use any of these classes is when you build a network using the constructor. In that case, you may set the `joint_dist` attribute, a dictionary with a `GaussianJointDistribution` object and a list with the nodes order."
